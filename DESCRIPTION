Description: This is package created as a final project for Spatial Data with R
    It is consisted of two functions and several accompanying methods. Function "storetracks"
    is used to create object of a class "mytrack" which holds lines defined by coordinates and
    accompanying metadata. There are three generic methods for this class (print, plot and summary)
    and one made especially for calculating distance of a track. Second function "multitracks" is
    used to create object of a class "multitracks" which acts as a container of multiple objects
    of a "mytrack" class. There are two generics (print and summary) and one additional function
    which is used to add a "mytrack" object to existing "multitracks" object.
